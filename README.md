## Objectives

  1. Implement nested resources for creation and modification

## Outline

  * Bring the solution over from the previous lab
  * Now just have them add in creating and editing
  * If they get to a song at `/song/:id` then it should ask them who the artist is. If they get through the nesting it should know and not be a drop down. Helpers!
